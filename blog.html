      <article class="post">
        <h2 class="post-title">Profession</h2>
        <p class="post-date">September 2024</p>
        <p>As you may already know, there is no such thing as the IT professional job. If you are an undergraduate IT
          professional, you have many options to choose from in the IT field. Almost every organization has to deal with
          some form of IT. That is why the job market for IT-professionals is huge. You can work in many different
          areas after graduating. Learn more about my dream companies, their company culture and type of work.</p>

      <article class="post">
        <h2 class="post-title">First feedback</h2>
        <p class="post-date">September 2024</p>
        <p>Giving and receiving feedback is incredibly important and truly beneficial. During our first week at HZ UAS,
          we participated in an over-the-shoulder code review with fellow students, following a structured four-step
          process. After the review, we had a checkpoint where we discussed common errors and defects identified during
          the process. I received very constructive and valuable feedback, which was helpful for improving my coding
          skills and code structure.</p>

      <article class="post">
        <h2 class="post-title">Programming experience</h2>
        <p class="post-date">April 2024</p>
        <p>Programming has always been a really fascinating and exciting field for me. My coding journey began in 2018
          when I wrote my first C# program during my first year of high school. My IT teacher played a crucial role in
          this experience - her enthusiasm, guidance, and innovative teaching methods truly ignited my passion for
          coding. This early exposure laid the foundation for my continued exploration and love for the field, inspiring
          me to dive deeper into various programming languages and technologies.</p>

      <article class="post">
        <h2 class="post-title">Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
        <p class="post-date">April 2024</p>
        <p>Before the start of the academic year at HZ UAS, every student had to fill in a personal SWOT analysis. By
          doing that, each student can analyze their personal strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and
          possible threats for their studies. In this article, I will list my answers of the SWOT analysis questions and
          provide more detailed information about them.</p>

      <article class="post">
        <h2 class="post-title">Study Choice</h2>
        <p class="post-date">April 2024</p>
        <p>Choosing a study programme is a big decision to make. For me, the process of selecting the right path was a
          journey of self-reflection, research, and understanding my long-term goals. In this article, I will share the
          key reasons that led me to pursue my chosen field of study, the factors that influenced my decision, and why I
          believe this path aligns perfectly with both my passions and future aspirations.</p>
