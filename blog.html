          <h2 class="post-title">Study Choice</h2>
          <p>Choosing a study programme is a big decision to make. For me, the process of selecting the right path was a journey of self-reflection, research, and understanding my long-term goals. In this article, I will share the key reasons that led me to pursue my chosen field of study, the factors that influenced my decision, and why I believe this path aligns perfectly with both my passions and future aspirations.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
          <p>Before the start of the academic year at HZ UAS, every student had to fill in a personal SWOT analysis. By doing that, each student can analyze their personal strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and possible threats for their studies. In this article, I will list my answers of the SWOT analysis questions and provide more detailed information about them.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Programming experience</h2>
          <p>Programming has always been a really fascinating and exciting field for me. My coding journey began in 2018 when I wrote my first C# program during my first year of high school. My IT teacher played a crucial role in this experience - her enthusiasm, guidance, and innovative teaching methods truly ignited my passion for coding. This early exposure laid the foundation for my continued exploration and love for the field, inspiring me to dive deeper into various programming languages and technologies.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">First feedback</h2>
          <p>Giving and receiving feedback is incredibly important and truly beneficial. During our first week at HZ UAS, we participated in an over-the-shoulder code review with fellow students, following a structured four-step process. After the review, we had a checkpoint where we discussed common errors and defects identified during the process. I received very constructive and valuable feedback, which was instrumental in improving my coding skills.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Profession</h2>
          <p>As you may already know, there is no such thing as the IT professional job. If you are an undergraduate IT professional, you have many options to choose from in the IT field. Almost every organization has to deal with some form of IT. That is why the job market for an IT-professional is huge. You can work in many different areas after graduating.  For mid-term decisions it is important to get a more detailed understanding of the IT field and possibilities. Learn more about my dream companies, their company culture and type of work.</p>
