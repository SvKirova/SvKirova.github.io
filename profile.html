                After graduation, I am excited to keep learning about IT. There is always something new to explore,
                and I am eager to dive into it. After I have completed the study program, I would like to become an
                IT professional such as a web developer or software engineer. These roles would allow me to apply
                the knowledge and skills I have gained during my studies to solve real-world problems and contribute
                to technological innovation. My decision will depend on my interests, goals and the opportunities
                available to me at the time of completion.
