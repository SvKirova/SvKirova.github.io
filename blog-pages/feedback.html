                <!-- Brief introduction -->
                <p>Giving and receiving feedback is incredibly important and truly beneficial. During our first week at
                    HZ UAS, we participated in an Over-the-shoulder code review with fellow students, following a
                    structured four-step process. After the review, we had a checkpoint where we discussed common errors
                    and defects identified during the process. I received very constructive and valuable feedback, which
                    was helpful for improving my coding skills and code structure.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>In June, I received the following feedback concerning my "Who am i" questionnaire in the Learn
                    Environment: "Hi Svetlozara,
                    Welcome and thank you for completing the Who am I questionnaire. I've been reviewing your answers
                    and I noticed that you have no questions. That's good, and I wish you a pleasant summer and we see
                    you next year. If there is anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask."
                    <br><br>
                    During the Over-the-shoulder code review at the university, I received valuable feedback from my
                    peers
                    regarding the design choices I made - particularly in terms of the color palette and fonts. Some of
                    the students pointed out that while my design was visually appealing, using a wide range of fonts
                    and colors could potentially make the overall look feel a bit inconsistent and not that beautiful.
                    They suggested that by
                    limiting the number of fonts and colors, I could create a more professional and pretty aesthetic.
                    This feedback has encouraged me to refine my approach to design, focusing on simplicity, detail and
                    consistency for better visual harmony. Moreover, some of my classmates suggested that I can make a
                    footer on every page of the website and put some useful links (my GitHub profile, my Email and the
                    university's website) for the users in it.
                    <br><br> During the Pitch Day, I gathered some really helpful feedback too. While
                    one of my classmates was reviewing my code structure and syntax, he saw that I didn't put the "meta
                    description" tag
                    that is used to define a description of a web page. Also, I received a suggestion to use the
                    "Beautify" extension in
                    Visual Studio Code to make my code structure prettier and more organized. Another person saw my file
                    structure and advised me to
                    rename some of the files so that the naming is more meaningful. This suggestion was made about my
                    blog files. They were all named like:
                    "...-css.css" (for example: "dashboard-css.css"). So he suggested renaming them to, for instance,
                    "...-style.css" ("dashboard-style.css"). This way,
                    the ending of the name of the file will be different from the file type and there won't be any
                    confusion for the maintainer while searching for a file.
                    Overall, I didn't receive any negative feedback - everything that my classmates and the teacher
                    assistant said was really beneficial for
                    the future improvement of my website.
