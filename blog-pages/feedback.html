                <p>Giving and receiving feedback is incredibly important and truly beneficial. During our first week at
                    HZ UAS, we participated in an Over-the-shoulder code review with fellow students, following a
                    structured four-step process. After the review, we had a checkpoint where we discussed common errors
                    and defects identified during the process. I received very constructive and valuable feedback, which
                    was instrumental in improving my coding skills.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>In June, I received the following feedback concerning my "Who am i" questionnaire: "Hi Svetlozara,
                    Welcome and thank you for completing the Who am I questionnaire. I’ve been reviewing your answers
                    and I noticed that you have no questions. That’s good, and I wish you a pleasant summer and we see
                    you next year. If there is anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask."
                    <br><br>
                    During the Over-the-shoulder code review at the university, I received valuable feedback from my peers
                    regarding the design choices I made, particularly in terms of the color palette and fonts. Some of
                    the students pointed out that while my design was visually appealing, using a wide range of fonts
                    and colors could potentially make the overall look feel a bit inconsistent. They suggested that by
                    limiting the number of fonts and colors, I could create a more professional aesthetic.
                    This feedback has encouraged me to refine my approach to design, focusing on simplicity and
                    consistency for better visual harmony.
