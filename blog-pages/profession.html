                <hr>
                <p>As you may already know, there is no such thing as the IT professional job. If you are an
                    undergraduate IT professional, you have many options to choose from in the IT field. Almost every
                    organization has to deal with some form of IT. That is why the job market for IT-professionals is
                    huge. You can work in many different areas after graduating. In this page you will learn more about
                    my dream
                    companies, their company culture and type of work.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of my dream companies are Apple, Google
                    and Microsoft. These companies are really popular in today's technology-driven world.
                    Their mission is to create innovative products and cutting-edge technology that can help people
                    in so many ways. I am looking for exactly that - the chance and ability
                    to work with very talented colleagues and contribute to positive changes in society.

                <h1 id="after-study">Microsoft</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered
                    in Redmond, Washington. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating
                    systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, the Azure cloud computing platform
                    and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the
                    Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. The American technology company
                    Microsoft employs approximately 228,000 people in full-time positions worldwide. Around 60 percent

                    include software engineers, product managers, data scientists, and cloud specialists. Their culture
                    is founded in a growth mindset.
                    <br> <br>
                    I want to work at Microsoft because I see it as the perfect place for me to
                    grow and continuously learn. The company's focus on a growth mindset really aligns with my personal
                    goals — I want to constantly challenge myself, expand my skills, and contribute to projects that
                    make
                    a real difference. Microsoft gives me the opportunity to do just that, whether it is through working
                    with cutting-edge technologies or collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the industry.

                    <br> <br>
                    I would want to work at Apple because of its focus on creating world-class, user-friendly products
                    that shape how people interact with technology. The culture at Apple emphasizes problem-solving,
                    innovation, and pushing boundaries, which aligns with my desire to work in a place where I can
                    contribute to transformative projects. Moreover, Apple’s commitment to privacy and sustainability
                    makes it a company I admire.
