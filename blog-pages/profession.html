                <p>As you may already know, there is no such thing as the IT professional job. If you are an
                    undergraduate IT professional, you have many options to choose from in the IT field. Almost every
                    organization has to deal with some form of IT. That is why the job market for an IT-professional is
                    huge. You can work in many different areas after graduating. For mid-term decisions it is important
                    to get a more detailed understanding of the IT field and possibilities. Learn more about my dream
                    companies, their company culture and type of work.
                    <br><br>
                    I do have some dream companies in mind I would like to work for in the future, such as Apple, Google
                    and Microsoft. The importance and magnitude of these corporations, along with their market share in
                    different parts of our technology-driven world, means that they strive for the best and put all
                    their time and resources towards innovating. I am looking for exactly that – the chance and ability
                    to work with very talented people and help innovate the technology space.

                    <br> <br>
                    I want to work at Microsoft because I see it as the perfect place for me to
                    grow and continuously learn. The company’s focus on a growth mindset really aligns with my personal
                    goals—I want to constantly challenge myself, expand my skills, and contribute to projects that make
                    a real difference. Microsoft gives me the opportunity to do just that, whether it’s through working
                    with cutting-edge technologies or collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the industry.
