                <!-- Brief intoduction -->
                <p>As you may already know, there is no such thing as the IT professional job. If you are an
                    undergraduate IT professional, you have many options to choose from in the IT field. Almost every
                    organization has to deal with some form of IT. That is why the job market for IT-professionals is
                    huge. You can work in many different areas after graduating. In this page you will learn more about
                    my dream
                    companies, their company culture and type of work.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of my dream companies are Apple, Google
                    and Microsoft. These companies are really popular in today's technology-driven world.
                    Their mission is to create innovative products and cutting-edge technology that can help people
                    in so many ways. I am looking for exactly that - the chance and ability
                    to work with very talented colleagues and contribute to positive changes in society.

                <!-- First company -->
                <h1 class="company">Microsoft</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered
                    in Redmond, Washington. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating
                    systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, the Azure cloud computing platform
                    and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the
                    Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. The American technology company
                    Microsoft employs approximately 228,000 people in full-time positions worldwide. Around 60 percent
                    of Microsoft's employees are located in the company's home country - the United States. Job roles
                    include software engineers, product managers, data scientists, and cloud specialists. Their culture
                    is founded in a growth mindset.
                    <br> <br>
                    I want to work at Microsoft because I see it as the perfect place for me to
                    grow and continuously learn. The company's focus on a growth mindset really aligns with my personal
                    goals â€” I want to constantly challenge myself, expand my skills, and contribute to projects that
                    make
                    a real difference. Microsoft gives me the opportunity to do just that, whether it is through working
                    with cutting-edge technologies or collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the industry.

                <!-- Second company -->
                <h1 class="company">Apple</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered and
                    incorporated in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It is best known for its consumer
                    electronics, software, and services. One of the most recognizable brands in the world, Apple created
                    the first commercially successful personal computer and was also the first to bring the graphical
                    user interface (GUI) into mass adoption. The company employed 164,000 full-time employees in 2022
                    and 154,000 employees in 2021. The number of
                    employees increased by 6%. Apple fosters a culture of innovation, encouraging employees to think
                    creatively and push boundaries. The company values new ideas and approaches, often prioritizing
                    design and user experience in its products. Their job roles range from hardware and software
                    engineers to product designers and retail specialists.
                    <br> <br>
                    I would want to work at Apple because of its focus on creating world-class, user-friendly products
                    that shape how people interact with technology. The culture at Apple emphasizes problem-solving,
                    innovation, and pushing boundaries, which aligns with my desire. Moreover, Apple's commitment to
                    privacy and sustainability
                    makes it a company I truly admire.

                <!-- Third company -->
                <h1 class="company">Google</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Google LLC is an American multinational corporation and technology company
                    focusing on online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software,
                    quantum computing, e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI). It has
                    been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world" and is one of the world's most
                    valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the
                    field of AI. Job roles at
                    Google range from software engineers and product managers to data scientists and UX/UI designers.
                    Google's employee count stands at 182,502, according to the latest data from the fourth quarter of
                    2023. This figure shows a slight decrease compared to the previous count of 182,381.
                    <br> <br>
                    I would want to work at Google because it represents a unique blend of innovation and opportunity.
                    The
                    chance to be at the forefront of technological advancements and contribute to impactful projects is
                    incredibly motivating.
