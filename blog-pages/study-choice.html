                <hr>
                <p>I have been fascinated by programming for a long time and always knew I wanted to study something in
                    that field. I chose ICT because it offers students and future software developers a wide range of
                    opportunities when it comes to coding. For instance, an ICT graduate can become a computer
                    programmer, software engineer, IT support specialist, IT security analyst, or systems designer,
                    among many other options. This path allows me to focus on programming while also exploring different
                    career directions, so I can discover what I enjoy most and pursue it further.
                    <br><br>
                    There are so many reasons why I chose to study in the Netherlands. To begin with, the country is
                    really internationally oriented - it welcomes students from over one hundred and sixty different
                    countries. Secondly, the Netherlands is known for its high-quality education system. Dutch
                    universities offer a wide variety of programs in various fields, innovative teaching methods and
                    work-integrated learning. Moreover, the Netherlands is one of the happiest and safest countries. It
                    has a robust and diversified economy and is a hub for technological innovation and research.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the main reasons why I am interested in this university is that it offers
                    practically-oriented education. Furthermore, HZ University of Applied Sciences is one of the most
                    forward-looking Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Another reason why I prefer
                    this university is the location. Middelburg is situated in a picturesque region. The city offers a
                    peaceful atmosphere, making it an ideal place for those seeking a quieter lifestyle. Additionally, I
                    selected HZ University of Applied Sciences because it will give me the opportunity to work in
                    exciting real-life projects for international companies and really apply my acquired knowledge into
                    practice. In addition, since 2011 HZ University of Applied Sciences has constantly been in the top
                    three of Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences.

                <h1 id="after-study">After completing the study</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>After graduation, I am excited to keep learning about IT. There is always something new to explore,
                    and I am eager to dive into it. After I have completed the study program, I would like to become an
                    IT professional such as a web developer or software engineer. These roles would allow me to apply
                    the knowledge and skills I have gained during my studies to solve real-world problems and contribute
                    to technological innovation. My decision will depend on my interests, goals and the opportunities
                    available to me at the time of completion. </p>
