                <hr>
                <p>I have been fascinated by programming for a long time and always knew I wanted to study something in that field. I chose ICT because it offers students and future software developers a wide range of opportunities when it comes to coding. For instance, an ICT graduate can become a computer programmer, software engineer, IT support specialist, IT security analyst, or systems designer, among many other options. This path allows me to focus on programming while also exploring different career directions, so I can discover what I enjoy most and pursue it further.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>After graduation, I am excited to keep learning about IT. There is always something new to explore, and I am eager to dive into it. After I have completed the study program, I would like to become an IT professional such as a web developer or software engineer. These roles would allow me to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained during my studies to solve real-world problems and contribute to technological innovation. My decision will depend on my interests, goals and the opportunities available to me at the time of completion. </p>
