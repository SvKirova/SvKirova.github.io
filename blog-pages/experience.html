                <p>Programming has always been a fascinating and exciting field for me. My coding journey began in 2018
                    when I wrote my first C# program during my first year of high school. My IT teacher played a crucial
                    role in this experience; her enthusiasm, guidance, and innovative teaching methods truly ignited my
                    passion for coding. This early exposure laid the foundation for my continued exploration and love
                    for the field, motivating me to delve deeper into various programming languages and technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    A few years ago, I received a special gift from my boyfriend that profoundly changed my perspective.
                    It was a flash drive with a single file on it—a batch (.bat) file labeled 'Open me.' Intrigued and
                    somewhat confused, I followed his instructions to open it. When I double-clicked the file, a Command
                    Prompt window appeared, displaying a series of questions. After answering them, the window closed
                    automatically, revealing a previously hidden folder on the flash drive. I was captivated by how my
                    responses had made the folder visible. This experience sparked a new level of curiosity in me about
                    programming and inspired me to envision the myriad types of software I could learn to create.
                    <br><br>
                    A few months later, during an IT class at school, my teacher noticed my eagerness to expand my
                    knowledge and suggested I attend a specialized Web Design course. I enrolled, and from that moment,
                    everything began to align with my growing passion for coding. My interest in programming has only
                    deepened over time, and I continue to explore and learn with enthusiasm.

                <h1 class="question">My programming experience</h1>
                <hr id="hr-down">
                <p class="answer">I have a little prior experience in programming. I completed the online course “Programming Basics
                    with JavaScript” by the Software University of Bulgaria (SoftUni) in July 2023. This course provided
                    me with a foundational understanding of JavaScript programming and basic problem-solving skills.
                    <br> <br> Additionally, I have participated in some web development courses in my hometown, where I learned
                    the basics of HTML and CSS and created simple websites. These experiences have given me a glimpse
                    into the world of programming and web development and while I may not have extensive expertise, I am
                    eager to continue learning and growing in this field. 
                    <br><br>My high school education also introduced me to
                    programming concepts through courses in Mathematics, Informatics and ICT, where I gained exposure to
                    languages like C#. While my experience may be limited, I am enthusiastic about expanding my skills
                    and pursuing opportunities to further develop my abilities in programming and technology.</p>
